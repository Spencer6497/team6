# Operation Hermes
NKU CSC439 Team 6

Operation Hermes is a development project working to streamline the ever increasing amount of online shopping that is bogging down warehouse management systems. 

With Operation Hermes, we plan to:

	Create an easier and more affordable way to manage incoming goods
	
	Manage the current inventory of a warehouse
	
	Use a similar approach to the incoming goods to also manage outgoing goods
	
	Track the amount of goods that are coming and going to show popularity of items
	
	Create a system that allows for the deployment throughout all facilities with stored data centers for trend accuracy
